    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: July 1, 2025</p>

    <p>At ModMorrowind Store, we care deeply about your privacy and are committed to safeguarding your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data when you visit our website, explore our products, or use any of our services. Please take a few minutes to read this policy carefully to understand our practices and how we aim to keep your information secure and confidential.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information to enhance your shopping experience and offer better services. This includes personal data you provide directly, such as your name, email address, mailing address, and payment details when you register an account, place an order, or subscribe to our newsletter. Additionally, we automatically gather certain technical data like your IP address, browser type, device identifiers, pages you visit, and time spent on our website through cookies, log files, and other tracking technologies. These tools help us understand user behavior and improve site functionality.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your personal information helps us in multiple ways: processing and delivering your orders, sending you important updates about your purchases, and responding to your inquiries or customer support requests. We also use this data to personalize your shopping experience, recommend products you might like, and inform you about new arrivals or exclusive promotions—always within the limits of your communication preferences. Additionally, we analyze aggregated data to identify trends, measure website performance, and make data-driven improvements to our content, design, and services.</p>

    <h2>Data Protection</h2>
    <p>Protecting your personal data is a top priority for us. We use industry-standard security measures, including secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption, regular security audits, and restricted access to personal data stored on our servers. While we do our best to protect your data, please understand that no online transmission or storage method can be guaranteed 100% secure. We encourage you to choose strong passwords and keep them confidential to help further protect your account.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>Cookies and similar technologies help us remember your preferences, provide secure logins, and offer tailored content. For example, cookies allow our cart to remember items you’ve added even if you leave the site temporarily. You can adjust your browser settings to refuse cookies or alert you when cookies are being sent; however, disabling cookies might limit certain features or affect your experience on our site.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
    <p>We sometimes partner with trusted third-party providers for services like payment processing, analytics, advertising, and hosting. These providers only receive the data necessary to perform their specific functions and are contractually obligated to handle your data securely and lawfully. Our site may also include links to external websites not operated by ModMorrowind Store. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites, and we recommend reviewing their individual privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You have several rights regarding your personal data, including the right to request access, correct inaccuracies, delete your data, or restrict its processing. If you'd like to exercise these rights or update your communication preferences, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@modmorrowind.com">info@modmorrowind.com</a>. We aim to respond to all legitimate requests promptly and transparently.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes in technology, legal requirements, or our business operations. Whenever we make significant updates, we will post the revised policy on this page and, where appropriate, notify you via email or website notification. We encourage you to check this page regularly to stay informed about how we protect your data.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, concerns, or suggestions about our Privacy Policy or data practices, please get in touch at <a href="mailto:info@modmorrowind.com">info@modmorrowind.com</a> or call us at +1 (416) 555‑0143. We’re always here to help ensure your information stays private and secure.</p>

    <p>By using our website, you acknowledge and agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Your trust is important to us, and we’re committed to treating your personal data with respect and care.</p>
