    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p>Effective date: July 1, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to ModMorrowind Store. By accessing or using our website, you acknowledge and agree to comply with these Terms & Conditions, which govern your use of our platform, products, and services. If you do not accept these terms in full, please refrain from using our website or making any purchases. We recommend reviewing this page regularly, as continued use of our website constitutes acceptance of any updates or modifications we may make over time.</p>

    <h2>Use of Our Platform</h2>
    <p>ModMorrowind Store provides an e-commerce platform specializing in digital products related to The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, including exclusive mods, premium skins, and curated gift cards. You agree to use our platform solely for lawful purposes, in accordance with these terms, and in a way that does not infringe upon the rights of others or restrict or inhibit anyone else’s use and enjoyment of the site. Unlawful or prohibited behavior includes, but is not limited to, attempting to gain unauthorized access to accounts, uploading malicious code, or using our services to facilitate illegal activities.</p>

    <h2>User Accounts</h2>
    <p>Creating an account allows you to access certain features such as order history, wish lists, and personalized recommendations. When you register, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information about yourself. You must promptly update your details if they change. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities carried out under your account. If you suspect unauthorized use of your account, please notify us immediately so we can help protect your data and secure your account.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content and materials on ModMorrowind Store—including text, graphics, logos, product descriptions, icons, images, audio clips, digital downloads, and software—are the exclusive property of ModMorrowind Store or its licensors and are protected by Canadian and international copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, reproduce, republish, upload, distribute, sell, or create derivative works based on our content without our prior written consent. Limited personal use, such as saving product pages for personal reference, is allowed as long as it does not violate these terms or applicable law.</p>

    <h2>Purchases & Payments</h2>
    <p>By placing an order on ModMorrowind Store, you agree to pay the full amount listed at checkout, including applicable taxes or fees. Prices may change at our discretion without prior notice, but confirmed orders will not be affected by subsequent price adjustments. We use secure third-party payment processors to handle transactions, and you agree to their terms and policies when completing your purchase. ModMorrowind Store reserves the right to limit quantities, refuse orders suspected of fraud, or cancel transactions deemed suspicious or unauthorized.</p>

    <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>Due to the digital and non-returnable nature of our products, all sales are final. Once digital goods (such as mods or gift cards) have been delivered to your account or email, we do not offer refunds or exchanges. If you encounter technical issues accessing your purchased items, please reach out to our customer support team, who will make reasonable efforts to resolve the problem promptly.</p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use & Conduct</h2>
    <p>When using our platform, you agree not to misuse any of our services or engage in behavior that could harm the site, its users, or our reputation. This includes, but is not limited to: transmitting malware or viruses; scraping or data mining; posting harmful, offensive, or illegal content; attempting to gain unauthorized access to other user accounts; or using automated systems to interact with the website. ModMorrowind Store reserves the right to investigate and take action against violations, including suspending or terminating user accounts and reporting illegal activities to authorities.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services & Links</h2>
    <p>Our site may feature links to third-party websites, services, or resources, such as payment providers, social media platforms, or partner sites. These links are provided for your convenience only. We do not control and are not responsible for the content, policies, or practices of these third-party sites. Accessing them is at your own risk, and we encourage you to review their respective terms and privacy policies before interacting with them or providing any personal data.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the website without notice if, in our sole judgment, you violate these Terms & Conditions, applicable laws, or engage in activities harmful to us or other users. Termination does not affect any outstanding rights or obligations that accrued prior to termination.</p>

    <p>We may occasionally revise these Terms & Conditions to reflect updates in our services, legal requirements, or business practices. Changes become effective immediately upon posting on this page, unless otherwise noted. Your continued use of ModMorrowind Store following any update indicates your acceptance of the revised terms. We encourage you to review this page regularly to stay informed.</p>
